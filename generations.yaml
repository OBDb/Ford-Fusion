    description: "The original North American Ford Fusion was a mid-size sedan designed to replace the aging Taurus in Ford's lineup. Built on the Mazda-derived CD3 platform shared with the Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ, it featured conservative but clean styling with a distinctive three-bar grille. Initially offered with a 2.3L four-cylinder or 3.0L V6 engine, a Sport model with a 3.5L V6 was added later in the generation. Transmission options included a five-speed manual and five or six-speed automatics. The interior was spacious and functional, with an emphasis on quality materials and good ergonomics. A significant refresh in 2010 updated the styling, powertrain efficiency, and technology features. This generation established the Fusion as a solid competitor in the mid-size sedan segment, known for balanced handling, good build quality, and value."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    end_year: 2020
    description: "The redesigned Fusion represented a dramatic shift in design philosophy, featuring sleek, European-inspired styling often compared to Aston Martin. Built on Ford's CD4 global platform, it offered a wider range of powertrains including naturally aspirated and turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder engines, a V6 Sport model with a twin-turbo 2.7L EcoBoost producing 325 HP, and hybrid/plug-in hybrid variants. Available with front or all-wheel drive, it emphasized both efficiency and performance. The interior featured a modern design with improved materials and technology, including the SYNC infotainment system and later SYNC 3. A refresh in 2017 updated the styling and added enhanced safety features through Ford Co-Pilot360. This generation elevated the Fusion's status, competing effectively with class leaders like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry by offering advanced technology, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale design. Despite strong critical reception, changing consumer preferences toward SUVs led to Ford's decision to discontinue the Fusion after 2020 as part of a broader shift away from traditional passenger cars in North America."
